A nutritious diet is essential to healthy brain development in children, which is critical to good learning.

Our school kitchen team prepares fresh meals every day on site. As well as a range of wholesome, nutritious and delicious snacks and meals for all, the team also provides for students with special dietary needs.

There is a daily morning snack, afternoon snack, and at lunchtime a soup starter and two main courses, one of each being a vegetarian option. Parents are provided with a menu in advance of each week and are able to select the food they would like their children to be served each day.
Having good eating habits and a balanced diet supports children’s health and wellbeing, and minimises the risk of illness. Eating habits developed in the early years are likely to have a lifelong influence. 

Fruit is naturally available daily.

The school works with the best suppliers that meet stringent criteria and are certified for importing raw materials into the school kitchen.
